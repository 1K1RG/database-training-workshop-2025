## This is the first header

I've been working on this Markdown site for a couple of days now, and it's time to add another post so that I can build the main page.

I also want to see how a few things look, like

- Lists
- With 
- Bullets

and...

1. Lists 
2. With
3. Numbers

### What about an h3?

Yeah it will be cool to see how that looks too.

### Highlighted code

Highlight some javascript!

```javascript
let string = "Testing";
console.log(string); // Testing
```

And what about adding an image?

Yes, images work too! Don't host images in your git repo though, your repository will become massive. Host them somewhere else. The one above is hosted by [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/npxXWgQ33ZQ) but you shouldn't do that in production either! I tend to put my images in a seperate place like Google Drive or a seperate Netlify site (manually uploaded) and then proxy the URL I want them on. 


And a video?

</figure>

The end.
