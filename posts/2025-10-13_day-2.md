## SNP-MERN and SNP-Spring

SNP-MERN and SNP-Spring are web-based systems developed under Activity 5 to enable rice researchers and breeders to **visualize and analyze SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) and genotype data** from rice genomes.

Both systems have an almost identical **microservices** architecture. This design allows individual components to be maintained or scaled independently, improving reliability and performance.

### SNP-MERN System Architecture

SNP-MERN is built using the **MERN** stack: **_MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js_**.

### SNP-Spring System Architecture

SNP-Spring uses **React** for the frontend, **Spring Boot** for the backend, and **MongoDB** for the database.

## What is an API?

An API (or Application Programming Interface) acts as a bridge between an application and its database.

### Why We Make APIs

- **Security**: Prevents clients from having direct access to the database which may potentially be used for malicious intentions.
- **Abstraction**: Users don't need to know how or where data is stored.
- **Reusability**: The same API can serve multiple clients, whether it be a website, mobile app, terminal-based, etc.
- **Consistency**: Ensures all users receive data in a standard format.
- **Scalability**: Databases can be modified without breaking the frontend.

## Introduction to Databases

A database is an organized system for storing, managing, and retrieving information.

### Why We Need Databases

- **Organization**: Keeps data consistent and searchable.
- **Reliability**: Prevents data loss or duplication.
- **Collaboration**: Lets multiple people use the same data safely.
- **Scalability**: Handles growing data sizes as projects expand.
- **Automation**: Enables applications to access and analyze data automatically.

## Relational vs. Non-relational Databases

| Feature                | **Relational / SQL**                                                                 | **Non-Relational / NoSQL**                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Structure**          | Tables with rows & columns                                                           | Collections of documents, key-value pairs, etc.                                          |
| **Schema**             | _Strict:_ data must follow a predefined structure of tables, columns, and data types | _Flexible/Optional:_ each document can have different fields or structures               |
| **Data Relationships** | _Enforced:_ tables are linked through foreign keys and constraints                   | _Loose:_ relationships are managed in the application layer, not by the database         |
| **Data Duplication**   | _Normalized:_ data is split across tables to minimize redundancy; requires joins     | _Often denormalized:_ data is duplicated for faster reads; harder to update consistently |
| **Examples**           | PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite                                                            | MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra, DynamoDB                                                      |
| **Best For**           | Structured, transactional data                                                       | Unstructured or rapidly changing data                                                    |

## PostgreSQL Basics

PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system.

### Service Management Commands

```bash
# Start PostgreSQL service
sudo systemctl start postgresql

# Check PostgreSQL service status
sudo systemctl status postgresql

# Stop PostgreSQL service
sudo systemctl stop postgresql
```

### Connecting to PostgreSQL

```bash
# Connect as postgres user (default superuser)
# sudo -u <username> psql
sudo -u postgres psql

# Connect to a specific database
# sudo -u <username> psql -d <database_name>
sudo -u postgres psql -d rgdb

# Execute SQL script from file
# sudo -u postgres psql -d <database_name> -f <path_to_sql_file.sql>
sudo -u postgres psql -d rgdb -f /mnt/c/Users/garth/Downloads/163.sql
# (loading the `163.sql` file may take 10 to 30 minutes)
```

### Structure of an SQL table

In SQL, data is stored in **tables composed of rows and columns**.

- **Columns** define the attributes or fields of the data.
- **Rows** represent individual records, each containing values for those attributes.

### Essential psql Commands

```sql
-- List all databases
\l

-- Connect to a different database
-- \c <database_name>
\c rgdb

-- List all tables in current database
\dt

-- Describe the structure of a specific table
-- \d <table_name>
\d snp_featureloc

-- Quit psql
\q

-- Help with SQL commands
\h

-- Help with psql commands
\?
```

### Basic SQL Operations

Note: Do not forget the semi-colon at the end of each operation

#### SELECT Queries

```sql
-- Retrieve all rows and columns from a table
-- SELECT * FROM <table_name>;
SELECT * FROM variantset;

-- Retrieve a table showing only the first `n` rows
-- SELECT * FROM <table_name> LIMIT <number>;
SELECT * FROM snp_featureloc LIMIT 10;

-- Retrieve specific fields from a table
-- SELECT <field1>, <field2> FROM <table_name>;
SELECT position, refcall FROM snp_featureloc LIMIT 10;

-- Retrieve rows from a table that match a specific condition
-- SELECT * FROM <table_name> WHERE <condition>;
SELECT * FROM snp_featureloc WHERE refcall = 'C' LIMIT 10;
SELECT * FROM snp_featureloc WHERE position BETWEEN 11217 AND 12434 LIMIT 10;
SELECT * FROM snp_featureloc WHERE (position BETWEEN 11217 AND 12434) AND refcall = 'A' LIMIT 10;

-- Retrieve specific fields with custom field names
SELECT refcall AS reference_call, position + 1 AS position FROM snp_featureloc WHERE refcall = 'C' LIMIT 10;
SELECT refcall reference_call, position + 1 position FROM snp_featureloc WHERE refcall = 'C' LIMIT 10;

-- Retrieve rows from a table, sorted by a field in descending order
-- SELECT * FROM <table_name> ORDER BY <field> <ASC or DESC>;
SELECT * FROM snp_featureloc ORDER BY position LIMIT 10;
SELECT * FROM snp_featureloc ORDER BY position ASC LIMIT 10;
SELECT * FROM snp_featureloc ORDER BY position DESC LIMIT 10;
```

#### INSERT Operations

```sql
-- Add a new row
-- INSERT INTO <table_name> (<field1>, <field2>) VALUES (<value1>, <value2>);
INSERT INTO snp_featureloc (snp_featureloc_id, refcall)
VALUES (30_000_000, 'A');

-- Add new rows at once
-- INSERT INTO <table_name> (<field1>, <field2>) VALUES (<values1>), (<values2>);
INSERT INTO snp_featureloc (snp_featureloc_id, refcall)
VALUES
    (30_000_001, 'T'),
    (30_000_002, 'G');

-- Add a new row and get back specific fields
-- INSERT INTO <table_name> (<fields>) VALUES (<values>) RETURNING <fields>;
INSERT INTO snp_featureloc (snp_featureloc_id, refcall)
VALUES (30_000_003, 'C')
RETURNING *;
```

#### UPDATE Operations

```sql
-- Modify values in an existing row that matches a specific condition
-- UPDATE <table_name> SET <field> = <value> WHERE <condition>;
UPDATE snp_featureloc
SET position = 200
WHERE snp_featureloc_id = 30_000_000;

-- Modify multiple values in an existing row at the same time
-- UPDATE <table_name> SET <field1> = <value1>, <field2> = <value2> WHERE <condition>;
UPDATE snp_featureloc
SET position = 300, snp_featureloc_id = 40_000_000
WHERE snp_featureloc_id = 30_000_000;

-- Modify data in rows that match multiple conditions
-- UPDATE <table_name> SET <fields> = <value> WHERE <condition>;
UPDATE snp_featureloc
SET refcall = 'T'
WHERE snp_featureloc_id = 40_000_000 AND position = 300;
```

#### DELETE Operations

```sql
-- Delete rows that match a specific condition
-- DELETE FROM <table_name> WHERE <condition>;
DELETE FROM variant_variantset WHERE variant_feature_id = 10;
DELETE FROM variant_variantset WHERE hdf5_index < 5;

-- Delete all rows from a table (use with extreme caution!)
-- DELETE FROM <table_name>;
DELETE FROM users;
```

#### Basic JOIN

```sql
-- Combine rows from two tables based on matching column values
-- SELECT <field> FROM <table1> JOIN <table2> ON <table1.field> = <table2.field>;
SELECT * FROM snp_featureloc JOIN variant_variantset
ON snp_feature_id = variant_feature_id
LIMIT 10;
```

### Example complex query for searching by genotype

```sql
SELECT
    sfl.snp_feature_id,
    sfl.srcfeature_id - 2 AS chromosome,
    sfl.position + 1 AS "position",
    sfl.refcall,
    vvs.hdf5_index AS allele_index,
    v.variantset_id AS type_id,
    v.name AS variantset
FROM
    snp_featureloc sfl
    JOIN variant_variantset vvs ON sfl.snp_feature_id = vvs.variant_feature_id
    JOIN variantset v ON vvs.variantset_id = v.variantset_id
WHERE
    sfl.organism_id = 9
    AND sfl.srcfeature_id = 3
    AND sfl.position BETWEEN 11217 AND 12434
    AND v.name IN ('1k1')
ORDER BY
    sfl.position;
```

## MongoDB Overview

MongoDB is a non-relational (NoSQL) database.

Unlike SQL databases that use tables with rows and columns, MongoDB stores data in **collections** of **documents**.

**Analogy:**

| **SQL Term** | **MongoDB Equivalent** |
| ------------ | ---------------------- |
| Table        | Collection             |
| Row          | Document               |
| Column       | Field                  |

A document in MongoDB is a key-value structure written in JSON syntax.
It can contain nested objects and arrays, allowing rich and flexible data representation.

### Example document from the `snp_featureloc` collection:

  }
}
```

## Data Duplication

In relational databases like PostgreSQL, data is stored in separate tables and linked using foreign keys. This **normalized design avoids duplication** by keeping related information in different tables. When combined information is needed, a `JOIN` operation is used to merge the tables.

MongoDB, on the other hand, encourages **denormalization**: storing related information together within a single document. This approach can result in data duplication because the same fields name might appear in several documents. However, the trade-off is to **improve performance and simplifies queries**.

### Example in PostgreSQL:

| **Table: snp_featureloc** |             |          |         |
| ------------------------- | ----------- | -------- | ------- |
| snp_featureloc_id         | organism_id | position | refcall |
| 1                         | 9           | 1127     | C       |

| **Table: organism** |                                  |       |                            |                     |          |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----- | -------------------------- | ------------------- | -------- |
| organism_id         | abbreviation                     | genus | species                    | common_name         | comment  |
| 9                   | O.sativa spp japonica nipponbare | Oryza | sativa japonica nipponbare | Japonica nipponbare | _(null)_ |

To combine data from both tables, we use a `JOIN`:

```sql
SELECT position, refcall, genus, species, common_name
FROM snp_featureloc
JOIN organism ON snp_featureloc.organism_id = organism.organism_id;
```

This **avoids data duplication**. The organism’s details are stored only once, even if thousands of SNPs belong to the same organism.

### Example in MongoDB

Instead of separating `snp_featureloc` and `organism`, both can be stored in one document:

```json
{
  "snp_featureloc_id": 1,
  "position": 1127,
  "refcall": "C",
  "organism": {
    "organism_id": 9,
    "abbreviation": "O.sativa spp japonica nipponbare",
    "genus": "Oryza",
    "species": "sativa japonica nipponbare",
    "common_name": "Japonica nipponbare"
  }
}
```

This makes it easy to retrieve all relevant information for one SNP in a single query, without performing a `JOIN`.
However, if the same organism appears in many documents, its details are repeated, introducing data duplication.
